            I love to snow ski. I have been skiing in several states across the US, beginning when I was 3 years old. Below are pictures of me and my sister Samantha, as well as me with my boyfriend, Tyler, whom I taught to ski a few years ago (now he is better than I am!).

            I love to bike and run, especially with my dog Moon. Yes, you heard that right - my dog and I run together and <em>bike</em> together! I use a special harness and leash so she can run next to my bike. I began running about a year ago, so now we rotate between biking and running. We do between 2 and 5 miles every morning, and we walk in the evenings. Moon is almost 4 years old, and she is a sweetheart. Tyler and I enjoy playing with her every chance we get, and she loves the outdoors. Below are a few pictures of Moon and me at Forest Park, where her favorite trails are.

            My final, and most expensive, hobby is traveling. Tyler and I love to travel around the country and see all kinds of places. We love being outdoors; trail-hiking, biking, fishing, and swimming are some of our favorite things to do. But we love to do them in unique places! I have also traveled internationally; below are a few great pictures from the month I spent in Thailand.
